## Panama Labor Code (Código de Trabajo)

### Overview of Panama Labor Law

**Legal Framework:**
- Labor Code: Primary employment law
- Executive decrees and regulations
- Ministry of Labor (MITRADEL) oversight
- Labor Courts for dispute resolution
- Strong employee protections (civil law system)

**Key Principles:**
- Presumption in favor of employee (pro operario)
- Continuous employment presumed (indefinite contracts default)
- Mandatory benefits cannot be waived
- Written contracts required within 15 days
- Termination requires just cause or severance payment
- Collective bargaining rights protected

### Types of Employment Contracts

**1. Indefinite Contract (Contrato por Tiempo Indefinido)**

**Most Common for Startups:**
- No specified end date
- Continues until terminated by either party
- Provides maximum job security
- Full mandatory benefits apply
- Severance required if terminated without cause
- Can be terminated with just cause (no severance)

**When to Use:**
- Permanent hires (engineers, sales, operations)
- Core team members
- Standard for most positions
- Default if no contract type specified

**2. Fixed-Term Contract (Contrato por Tiempo Definido)**

**Limited Use Cases:**
- Maximum 1 year (renewable up to 3 years total)
- Must have specific project or temporary need
- Cannot be used for permanent positions
- If renewed >3 years, converts to indefinite
- Full benefits still apply
- No severance if ends at term (severance if terminated early)

**When to Use:**
- Specific projects with clear end date
- Seasonal work (rare in tech)
- Temporary replacement (maternity leave coverage)
- Trial for specific initiative

**Warning:** Misusing fixed-term contracts can result in automatic conversion to indefinite + penalties

**3. Task-Based Contract (Contrato por Obra Determinada)**

**Project-Specific:**
- Ends when specific work/project completed
- Common in construction, not typical for tech
- Clear deliverable must be defined
- Full benefits apply during project
- Can be longer than 1 year if project requires

**When to Use (Rare in Tech):**
- Specific software project with clear deliverable
- Implementation project for client
- Must be genuine task-based, not ongoing role

**4. Contractor/Freelancer (Prestación de Servicios Profesionales)**

**Not an Employee:**
- Independent contractor relationship
- No employer-employee relationship
- No mandatory benefits required
- 10% income tax withholding (or 2% for professionals)
- No CSS contributions from company
- Must be genuinely independent

**True Contractor Criteria:**
- Provides services to multiple clients
- Uses own tools and equipment
- Controls own schedule and methods
- Invoices for services
- Bears own business risk
- Not integrated into company operations

**Warning:** Misclassified contractors = treated as employees + back pay + penalties + fines

### Mandatory Employee Benefits (Non-Negotiable)

**1. 13th Month Salary (Décimo Tercer Mes / Aguinaldo)**

**What It Is:**
- Mandatory bonus = 1/3 of annual salary
- Calculation: Total annual wages earned ÷ 3
- Paid in 3 equal installments:
  - April 15 (covers Jan 1 - Apr 15)
  - August 15 (covers Apr 16 - Aug 15)
  - December 15 (covers Aug 16 - Dec 15)

**Calculation Example:**
```
Employee hired: January 1, 2024
Annual salary: $36,000 ($3,000/month)

13th Month: $36,000 ÷ 3 = $12,000 per year

Payment Schedule:
- April 15: $4,000 (3.5 months worked)
- August 15: $4,000 (4 months worked)
- December 15: $4,000 (4.5 months worked)

Pro-Rated for Partial Year:
Hired July 1, worked 6 months
13th Month: ($3,000 × 6 months) ÷ 3 = $6,000 annual
First payment Dec 15: $6,000 (pro-rated)
```

**Key Rules:**
- Includes all wages: base, bonuses, commissions
- Cannot be waived or negotiated
- Accrues from first day of employment
- Pro-rated for partial years
- Must be paid even if employee resigns
- Failure to pay = 3x the amount owed + penalties

**2. Vacation (Vacaciones)**

**Entitlement:**
- 30 calendar days per year
- After completing 11 months of continuous service
- Paid at regular salary rate
- Employee chooses timing (with reasonable notice)
- Can accumulate up to 60 days maximum
- Unused vacation paid upon termination

**Calculation:**
```
Monthly salary: $3,000
Daily rate: $3,000 ÷ 30 = $100/day
Vacation pay (30 days): $3,000

Employee works 6 months then resigns:
Accrued vacation: (30 days ÷ 12 months) × 6 = 15 days
Vacation pay owed: 15 days × $100 = $1,500
```

**Key Rules:**
- Cannot be paid in lieu (except at termination)
- Employer can deny specific dates (operational needs)
- Split vacation allowed (minimum 7 days at once)
- Accrues monthly: 2.5 days per month
- Must use within 2 years or forfeit excess over 60 days

**3. Severance Pay (Preaviso y Antigüedad)**

Only required for **termination without just cause**

**A. Preaviso (Notice Pay):**
- 1 month salary after 2 years employment
- 2 months salary after 5+ years employment
- Can work notice period or receive pay in lieu
- Based on final month's salary

**B. Antigüedad (Seniority Pay):**
- 1 week salary per year of service
- Starts after 2 years employment
- Maximum: 12 weeks
- Based on average salary of last 6 months

**Calculation Example:**
```
Employee: 5 years of service
Final salary: $4,000/month
Average last 6 months: $3,800/month

Preaviso: 2 months × $4,000 = $8,000
Antigüedad: 5 weeks × ($3,800 ÷ 4.33) = $4,390
Total Severance: $12,390

Plus: Accrued vacation, 13th month, any unpaid wages
```

**Important:**
- NOT required if:
  - Employee resigns voluntarily
  - Termination with just cause
  - Fixed-term contract ends naturally
- Must be paid immediately upon termination
- Failure to pay = employee can claim 125% + legal costs

**4. Social Security (CSS)**

**Contributions:**
- Employer: 12.25% of gross salary
- Employee: 9.75% of gross salary
- Total: 22% to CSS

**Educational Insurance (Seguro Educativo):**
- Employer: 1.25% of gross salary
- Employee: 1.25% of gross salary
- Total: 2.5%

**Work Risk Insurance (Riesgo Profesional):**
- Employer: 1.44% of gross salary (varies by industry)
- Employee: 0%

**Total Payroll Tax Burden:**
- Employer: 14.94%
- Employee: 11.00%
- Total: 25.94% of gross salary

**Registration:**
- Employer must register with CSS
- Each employee registered within 3 days of hire
- Monthly contributions due by 15th
- Late payment = 3% monthly penalty + interest

### Just Cause Termination (No Severance)

**Valid Reasons Under Labor Code:**

**1. Dishonesty or Misconduct:**
- Theft or fraud
- Falsification of documents (including résumé)
- Disclosure of confidential information
- Competing against employer
- Accepting bribes or kickbacks

**2. Violence or Harassment:**
- Physical violence against employer, coworkers, clients
- Verbal abuse or threats
- Sexual harassment
- Workplace bullying

**3. Insubordination:**
- Repeated refusal to follow lawful instructions
- Refusal to perform assigned duties
- Serious disrespect toward supervisor

**4. Intoxication:**
- Reporting to work intoxicated (alcohol or drugs)
- Drug use during work hours
- Repeated intoxication issues

**5. Abandonment:**
- Absence without notice for 2+ consecutive days
- After warning, repeated absences
- Leaving work without permission

**6. Poor Performance (Difficult to Prove):**
- Incompetence or inability to perform role
- Requires extensive documentation
- Must show warnings and improvement plans
- Very difficult to sustain in court
- Usually better to pay severance

**7. Repeated Violations:**
- Multiple written warnings for same issue
- Progressive discipline documented
- Reasonable opportunity to improve given

**Critical Requirements for Just Cause:**
- **Immediate termination** (cannot wait weeks)
- **Written notice** stating specific cause
- **Documentation** supporting the cause
- **Proportionate** to the violation
- **Consistent** application of policies

**Burden of Proof:**
- Employer must prove just cause in court
- Employee presumed right (pro operario principle)
- Insufficient evidence = wrongful termination
- Penalties: Reinstatement + back pay + damages

**Best Practice:**
Most startups pay severance rather than fight just cause battle in court. Only terminate for cause in egregious situations (theft, violence, gross misconduct).

### Working Hours and Overtime

**Standard Working Hours:**

**Daytime Work:**
- 8 hours per day
- 48 hours per week (Monday-Saturday)
- Typical: 8am-5pm with 1-hour lunch
- Or: Monday-Friday 9am-6pm (5-day week acceptable)

**Mixed Schedule (Day and Night):**
- 7.5 hours per day
- 42.5 hours per week

**Night Work (6pm-6am):**
- 7 hours per day
- 42 hours per week

**Overtime Pay:**

**Hours 49-60 per week:**
- 1.25× regular hourly rate
- "Time and a quarter"

**Hours 61+ per week:**
- 1.5× regular hourly rate
- "Time and a half"

**Calculation Example:**
```
Monthly salary: $3,000
Hours per month: 208 (52 weeks × 48 hours ÷ 12)
Hourly rate: $3,000 ÷ 208 = $14.42/hour

Overtime week: 55 hours worked
Regular hours: 48 hours × $14.42 = $692.16
Overtime hours: 7 hours × $14.42 × 1.25 = $126.39
Total week pay: $818.55
```

**Rest Periods:**
- 1 hour lunch break (unpaid, can be 30 min with agreement)
- 1 day off per week (usually Sunday)
- If work on rest day = 1.5× pay for that day

**Public Holidays (Paid):**
Panama has 10+ public holidays per year
- Must be paid even if no work
- If work on holiday = 2× pay for that day

### Minimum Wage

**Panama Minimum Wage (2024):**
Varies by province and industry

**Panama City/Urban Areas:**
- General: ~$600-700/month
- Tech/professional work: Above minimum (not applicable)

**For Tech Startups:**

- Support: $800-$1,500/month
- Management: $3,000-$8,000/month

Minimum wage rarely relevant for professional tech roles.

### Probation Period

- Must still pay accrued vacation and 13th month

**After Probation:**

EMPLOYER:                              EMPLOYEE:

_________________________            _________________________
Date: [Date]                         Date: [Date]
```

**Remote Work Best Practices:**
- Clear expectations on availability and communication
- Regular video check-ins (daily standup, weekly 1-on-1)
- Over-communicate to avoid misunderstandings
- Provide equipment and home office stipend
- Trust employees (results over hours logged)
- Team bonding events (monthly or quarterly in-person)

### Contractor vs Employee Classification

**True Independent Contractor Characteristics:**

✅ **Contractor:**
- Services provided to multiple clients
- Controls own schedule and work methods
- Uses own equipment and tools
- Bears business risk (profit or loss)
- Invoices for services rendered
- No fixed schedule or location requirement
- Temporary or project-based work
- Specialized expertise for specific task
- Can delegate or subcontract work

❌ **Not Contractor (Actually Employee):**
- Works exclusively for one company
- Follows company schedule and instructions
- Uses company equipment and office
- Receives fixed monthly payment
- Integrated into company operations
- Indefinite ongoing relationship
- Performs core business functions
- Reports to manager like employees

**Misclassification Consequences:**

If classified as contractor but actually employee:
- Treated as employee from day 1
- Company owes: 13th month, vacation, CSS contributions (retroactive)
- Severance owed if terminated
- Fines from MITRADEL: $500-$5,000 per violation
- Employee can sue for benefits + damages
- Reputational damage

**Safe Classification Test:**
```
Answer honestly:

1. Works exclusively for our company?              YES = Employee risk
2. Follows our schedule/work hours?                YES = Employee risk
3. Uses our equipment/office?                      YES = Employee risk
4. Receives fixed monthly payment?                 YES = Employee risk
5. Integrated into team operations?                YES = Employee risk
6. Performs ongoing core business functions?       YES = Employee risk
7. Cannot delegate or subcontract?                 YES = Employee risk

If 4+ YES answers → High employee misclassification risk
```

**Best Practice:**
When in doubt, classify as employee. Cost of misclassification > cost of proper employment.

### Termination Process (Without Cause / Severance)

**Severance Calculation Example:**

```
Employee: Maria Rodriguez
Tenure: 3 years, 7 months (started July 1, 2021)
Final Date: February 15, 2025
Final Monthly Salary: $3,500
Average Last 6 Months: $3,400

CALCULATIONS:

1. Final Salary (Feb 1-15):
   $3,500 ÷ 30 days × 15 days = $1,750

2. Accrued Vacation:
   Years worked: 3.58
   Vacation earned: 3.58 × 30 days = 107.4 days
   Vacation taken: 75 days
   Vacation owed: 32.4 days × $116.67/day = $3,780

3. Accrued 13th Month:
   Last payment: December 15, 2024
   Period: Dec 16, 2024 - Feb 15, 2025 (2 months)
   Owed: ($3,500 × 2) ÷ 3 = $2,333

4. Preaviso (Notice Pay):
   3 years service = 1 month notice
   Preaviso: $3,500 × 1 = $3,500

5. Antigüedad (Seniority Pay):
   3 years × 1 week per year = 3 weeks
   Weekly salary: $3,400 ÷ 4.33 = $785.45
   Antigüedad: $785.45 × 3 = $2,356

TOTAL FINAL PAYMENT:
Final Salary:        $1,750
Vacation:            $3,780
13th Month:          $2,333
Preaviso:            $3,500
Antigüedad:          $2,356
─────────────────────────────

## Common HR Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Top 10 HR Mistakes Panama Startups Make

**1. Misclassifying Employees as Contractors**
❌ Problem: Treating employees as independent contractors to save costs
✅ Solution: Properly classify based on control, integration, and exclusivity tests
**Cost:** Back pay + CSS contributions + penalties + severance

**2. No Written Employment Contracts**
❌ Problem: Hiring without signed contracts
✅ Solution: Sign contract within 15 days of start, keep copies
**Cost:** Presumption of indefinite contract + employee-favorable terms

**3. Not Accruing 13th Month**
❌ Problem: Not setting aside money for 13th month payments
✅ Solution: Accrue 1/12 of monthly salary each month
**Cost:** Cash flow crisis + late payment penalties

**4. Ignoring Vacation Accrual**
❌ Problem: Not tracking or paying accrued vacation
✅ Solution: Track monthly accrual (2.5 days/month), pay at termination
**Cost:** 125% of owed vacation + legal fees if sued

**5. Inadequate Termination Documentation**
❌ Problem: Firing for "performance" without documentation
✅ Solution: Written warnings, PIP, thorough documentation before termination
**Cost:** Wrongful termination claim = reinstatement + back pay

**6. Using Fixed-Term Contracts for Permanent Roles**
❌ Problem: Repeatedly using 1-year contracts to avoid severance
✅ Solution: Use indefinite contracts for permanent positions
**Cost:** Automatic conversion to indefinite + penalties

**7. Not Paying Severance Immediately**
❌ Problem: Delaying final payments after termination
✅ Solution: Pay all final amounts within 3 business days max
**Cost:** 125% of owed amounts + interest + legal fees

**8. Poor Onboarding**
❌ Problem: No structured onboarding process
✅ Solution: 30-60-90 day onboarding plan, buddy system
**Cost:** Low productivity + higher turnover (20-30% leave in first 6 months)

**9. No Performance Management**
❌ Problem: No feedback until annual review (or never)
✅ Solution: Weekly 1-on-1s, quarterly OKR reviews, annual formal reviews
**Cost:** Disengaged employees + higher turnover

**10. Neglecting Company Culture**
❌ Problem: Treating culture as "nice to have" not priority
✅ Solution: Define values, hire/fire based on culture fit, invest in team building
**Cost:** Toxic culture = turnover + inability to attract talent

## Summary: The HR Mission

**Your Core Mandate:**

✅ **Hire Great People**: Attract and select top talent for startup
✅ **Stay Compliant**: Zero labor disputes or violations
✅ **Develop Talent**: Invest in growth and performance
✅ **Build Culture**: Create environment where people thrive
✅ **Retain Stars**: Keep best performers engaged and growing
✅ **Enable Scale**: Build HR foundation that scales 0 → 100+

**The HR Balancing Act:**
- Compliance vs Speed (must do both)
- Employee advocacy vs Company protection (not mutually exclusive)
- Process vs Flexibility (enough structure, not too much)
- Cost control vs Competitive pay (invest in people)

**Remember:**
Great HR is invisible when working well. Your success is measured by:
- Quality of talent attracted
- Zero legal issues
- High employee engagement
- Low regretted attrition
- Strong company culture
- Scalable processes

**As HR leader, you are the guardian of company culture and people success. Your work enables everything else - without great people, nothing else matters.**

Panama offers incredible talent at competitive costs. Your job is to attract, develop, and retain that talent while navigating Panama's employee-friendly labor laws. Done right, HR becomes a competitive advantage, not just a compliance function.
