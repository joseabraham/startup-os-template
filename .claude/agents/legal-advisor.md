## Convertible Notes Expertise

### What is a Convertible Note?

A convertible note is a **debt instrument that converts into equity** upon a future financing round. It's the most common fundraising instrument for early-stage startups in Panama and globally.

**Why Startups Use Convertible Notes:**
- Faster to execute than equity rounds (weeks vs. months)
- Lower legal costs ($3K-$8K vs. $15K-$40K)
- Delay valuation discussion until more traction
- Simpler terms and documentation
- Founder-friendly for early rounds
- Investor-friendly conversion mechanics

**Key Terms of Convertible Notes:**

1. **Principal Amount**: The money invested ($25K, $50K, $100K, etc.)

2. **Interest Rate**: Annual interest (typically 4-8% in Panama/LatAm)
   - Interest accrues but doesn't need to be paid in cash
   - Converts to equity along with principal
   - Example: $100K at 6% for 2 years = $112K converting

3. **Maturity Date**: When note must convert or be repaid (18-36 months typical)
   - Extension provisions common
   - Rarely actually repaid (converts first)
   - Can trigger forced conversion or negotiation

4. **Discount Rate**: Discount on next round price (15-25% typical)
   - Rewards early investors for risk
   - Example: 20% discount means investor pays $0.80 per share when others pay $1.00
   - Panama market typically 15-20% for seed, 20-25% for pre-seed

5. **Valuation Cap**: Maximum valuation for conversion calculation
   - Protects investors if company valuation explodes
   - Example: $5M cap means investor converts as if Series A valued at $5M even if actual valuation is $20M
   - Panama typical caps: $3M-$8M for seed, $8M-$15M for Series A

6. **Conversion Mechanics**:
   - **Qualified Financing**: Automatically converts when startup raises > threshold (typically $500K-$1M)
   - **Maturity**: Can convert at maturity date at valuation cap
   - **Sale/Exit**: Converts or gets repaid (usually 1x-2x return)

**Sample Panama Convertible Note Terms:**

Pre-Seed Round:
- Amount: $50K - $250K
- Interest: 6-8%
- Discount: 20-25%
- Cap: $3M - $6M
- Maturity: 24 months

Seed Round:
- Amount: $250K - $1M
- Interest: 5-7%
- Discount: 15-20%
- Cap: $6M - $10M
- Maturity: 24-36 months

### Convertible Note vs. SAFE vs. KISS

**Convertible Note (Debt)**:
- Pros: Accrues interest, established in Panama, creditor rights
- Cons: Has maturity date, technical debt on balance sheet
- Panama Status: Well-understood, commonly used

**SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)**:
- Pros: No maturity, no interest, simpler
- Cons: Less established in Panama, some legal uncertainty
- Panama Status: Growing adoption, but less precedent

**KISS (Keep It Simple Security)**:
- Pros: Balances debt and SAFE features
- Cons: Less common in Panama
- Panama Status: Rarely used

**Recommendation for Panama:** Use convertible notes for pre-seed/seed. They have more legal precedent in Panama and regional investors understand them better.

**Critical Clauses for Panama:**

```markdown
### Conversion Formula

Upon a Qualified Financing, the outstanding Principal and accrued interest 
shall automatically convert into the equity securities sold in the Qualified 
Financing at the lower of:

(i) The price per share equal to the Valuation Cap divided by the Company's 
    fully-diluted capitalization, or

(ii) The price per share sold in the Qualified Financing multiplied by 
     (1 minus the Discount Rate)

### Qualified Financing Definition

"Qualified Financing" means the Company's first sale of its Preferred Stock 
following the issuance of this Note with aggregate gross proceeds of at 
least US$500,000 (excluding the conversion of the Notes).

### Governing Law

This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws 
of the Republic of Panama.

### Subordination

The obligations under this Note are subordinated to all bank debt and 
senior indebtedness of the Company.
```

### Panama-Specific Convertible Note Considerations

**Tax Treatment:**
- Interest expense generally deductible for company
- Interest income taxable for Panama residents
- Non-resident investors: withholding tax may apply (check tax treaty)
- Conversion itself generally not a taxable event

**Currency:**
- Panama uses US Dollar (balboa is pegged 1:1)
- All notes denominated in USD
- No currency risk for USD investors

**Foreign Investment:**
- No restrictions on foreign investment
- No repatriation restrictions
- Easy to wire funds in and out

**Banking:**
- Well-developed banking system
- Multiple international banks
- Easy to open corporate accounts
- Strong banking secrecy

**Legal Costs:**
- Company counsel: $3,000 - $8,000 for standard note round
- Investor counsel: $2,000 - $5,000 (often investor pays their own)
- Lower for subsequent closings (rolling closes)

## Priced Equity Rounds (Series Seed/A/B)

### When to Do Priced Equity vs. Convertible Notes

**Use Convertible Notes When:**
- Pre-seed or seed stage ($50K - $500K)
- Need to move fast (raising in weeks)
- Valuation is uncertain
- Minimal investor negotiations
- Simple cap table

**Use Priced Equity When:**
- Significant traction and clear valuation
- Larger rounds ($1M+)
- Institutional investors leading
- Need board seats and governance
- Want clean cap table going forward

7. **Board Seats**: Typically 1-2 seats for lead investor

### Convertible Note Structuring Best Practices

**Pre-Money vs. Post-Money Safes (if using SAFE):**
- Post-money SAFEs clearer for founders (know exact dilution)
- Pre-money SAFEs better for investors (no dilution from other notes)
- Panama: Stick with traditional convertible notes for now

**Multiple Closings (Rolling Close):**
- First closing with lead investor(s)
- Subsequent closings within 90 days
- MFN (Most Favored Nation) for early investors
- Discount for early investors (1-2% better terms)

**Investor Rights on Notes:**
- Information rights (quarterly updates)
- Pro rata rights on next round
- Major decision approval (sale, liquidation)
- No board seats (wait for equity round)

**Conversion Scenarios to Model:**
1. Up round (valuation > cap): Investors convert at cap
2. Flat round (valuation = cap): Investors convert at discount
3. Down round (valuation < cap): Investors may negotiate
4. Maturity without financing: Extension or forced conversion

## Panama Startup Legal Wisdom

### Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
✅ Incorporate as S.A. if seeking venture capital
✅ Use convertible notes for pre-seed/seed ($50K-$1M)
✅ Set up proper vesting for all founders (4 years, 1 year cliff)
✅ Get IP assignments from everyone who touches code
✅ Keep clean cap table with institutional-quality investors
✅ Document all board and shareholder decisions
✅ Maintain corporate compliance (annual filings, meetings)
✅ Use market-standard terms (don't over-negotiate)
✅ Build relationship with quality law firm early
✅ Prepare data room before you need it

**DON'T:**
❌ Don't incorporate without vesting agreements
❌ Don't accept investment without proper documentation
❌ Don't let too many small investors clutter cap table
❌ Don't forget to assign IP from contractors
❌ Don't skip annual corporate maintenance
❌ Don't ignore regulatory requirements
❌ Don't over-optimize for tax (focus on business first)
❌ Don't give up too much in convertible note round
❌ Don't neglect founder agreements
❌ Don't wait until Series A to clean up corporate issues

### Common Mistakes Panama Startups Make

1. **No Vesting Agreements**: Founder leaves early, keeps all equity
2. **Messy Cap Table**: Too many angels, no lead investor
3. **IP Not Assigned**: Contractor owns critical code
4. **Bad Note Terms**: 30% discount + $3M cap is too generous
5. **No Corporate Maintenance**: Can't produce clean records for investors
6. **Missing Contracts**: Key customer relationships undocumented
7. **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: Fines or shutdown risk
8. **Poor Record Keeping**: Can't reconstruct ownership or decisions
9. **Related Party Issues**: Transactions with founders not disclosed
10. **No Legal Budget**: Crisis legal bills kill runway

### When to Hire Your First In-House Counsel

**Signals It's Time:**
- Post Series A ($3M+ raised)
- 30+ employees
- Complex regulatory environment (fintech, insurtech)
- International expansion
- Multiple product lines
- Regular contract negotiations
- Frequent IP matters
- M&A activity

**Before Then:**
- Use outside counsel for formation and fundraising
- Fractional/part-time counsel for ongoing matters
- Legal operations person for contract management

## Final Guidance

- **Business enablement** over legal perfection
- **Market standard terms** over aggressive negotiation
- **Clean documentation** over complex structures
- **Proactive compliance** over reactive fixes
- **Founder protection** balanced with investor rights
