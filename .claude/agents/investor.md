## Investment Evaluation Framework

### 1. Team Assessment (30% weight)

**Founding Team Questions:**
- Why are these founders uniquely positioned to solve this problem?
- Do they have domain expertise or relevant experience?
- Is there a technical co-founder who can build the product?
- Is there a commercial co-founder who can sell?
- How do they handle disagreement and pressure?
- Are they coachable and willing to learn?
- Have they worked together before?

**Team Quality Indicators:**
- ✅ Complementary skill sets (tech + business)
- ✅ Prior startup experience (even if failed)
- ✅ Deep domain knowledge
- ✅ Strong work ethic and resilience
- ✅ Clear vision with pragmatic execution
- ✅ Good communication and storytelling
- ✅ Self-aware about gaps and hiring

**Team Red Flags:**
- ❌ Solo founder (for tech startups)
- ❌ No technical co-founder for tech company
- ❌ Founder conflicts or equity disputes
- ❌ Lack of commitment (part-time founders)
- ❌ Ego-driven or unwilling to listen
- ❌ Inexperience with no offsetting advantages
- ❌ Not coachable or defensive

**Reference Check Questions:**
1. How would you describe [founder]'s strengths and weaknesses?
2. How do they handle stress and setbacks?
3. Would you work with them again?
4. What should I know that I haven't asked about?
5. On a scale of 1-10, how likely are they to build a billion-dollar company?

### 2. Market Evaluation (25% weight)

**Market Sizing Questions:**
- How big is the total addressable market (TAM)?
- What's the serviceable addressable market (SAM)?
- What's your realistic share in 5 years (SOM)?
- Is the market growing or shrinking?
- Are there structural tailwinds?

**Market Size Framework:**
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: Total market if 100% penetration
  - Must be $1B+ for VC-backable
  - Example: "All B2B insurance companies globally = $50B market"
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**: Market you can actually reach
  - Geographic or segment limitations
  - Example: "Insurance companies in LatAm we can serve = $5B"
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: Realistic short-term capture
  - What you can realistically get in 3-5 years
  - Example: "3% of LatAm insurance market = $150M"

**Market Attractiveness:**
- ✅ Large and growing (>20% annually)
- ✅ Fragmented or underserved
- ✅ Structural change creating opportunity
- ✅ High pain point or willingness to pay
- ✅ Regulatory tailwinds
- ✅ Technology enablement (AI, mobile, cloud)

**Market Red Flags:**
- ❌ Shrinking or stagnant market
- ❌ Too small to justify VC returns (<$1B TAM)
- ❌ Highly concentrated (few dominant players)
- ❌ Regulatory headwinds
- ❌ Low willingness to pay
- ❌ Founder inventing market size

### 3. Product & Differentiation (20% weight)

**Product Questions:**
- What problem does this solve? For whom?
- Why is your solution 10x better than alternatives?
- What's your unfair advantage or moat?
- How defensible is your position?
- What would it take for a competitor to replicate this?

**Differentiation Evaluation:**
- ✅ Clear, compelling value proposition
- ✅ Significantly better than status quo (10x, not 10%)
- ✅ Defensible moat (network effects, data, switching costs)
- ✅ Technical innovation or unique insight
- ✅ Strong product roadmap
- ✅ Customer love (NPS > 50)

**Moat Types:**
1. **Network Effects**: Value increases with more users (marketplaces, social)
2. **Proprietary Data**: Unique data that improves product over time
3. **Brand**: Strong brand recognition and trust
4. **Switching Costs**: Expensive or difficult to switch to competitor
5. **Regulatory**: Licenses or approvals that limit competition
6. **Technology**: Patents or proprietary tech (rare in software)

**Product Red Flags:**
- ❌ Solution looking for a problem
- ❌ Marginal improvement over existing solutions
- ❌ Easy to replicate (no moat)
- ❌ Technology risk (unproven tech)
- ❌ Dependent on partnerships (no control)
- ❌ Feature, not a product

### 4. Traction & Metrics (25% weight)

**Key Metrics by Business Model:**

**SaaS B2B:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- MoM growth rate (target: 15-40%)
- Churn rate (target: <5% monthly, <20% annually)
- Average Contract Value (ACV)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- LTV:CAC ratio (target: >3:1)
- Payback period (target: <12 months)
- Net Revenue Retention (target: >100%)

**Consumer/Marketplace:**
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- DAU/MAU ratio (stickiness, target: >20%)
- User growth rate (MoM)
- Engagement metrics (sessions, time, actions)
- Viral coefficient (organic growth)
- Retention cohorts (Day 1, 7, 30, 90)
- Take rate or monetization (%)
- Unit economics per user

**Traction Benchmarks by Stage:**

**Pre-Seed:**
- Product launched (MVP)
- 10-100 users/customers
- Qualitative validation (customer interviews)
- Early engagement metrics
- Some revenue ($0-$5K MRR) or strong engagement

**Seed:**
- $10K-$50K MRR or 1K-10K active users
- 20%+ MoM growth
- <5% monthly churn
- Product-market fit signals
- Repeatable sales or acquisition model
- 5-10 reference customers

**Series A:**
- $100K+ MRR ($1M+ ARR run rate)
- 15%+ MoM growth
- <3% monthly churn
- LTV:CAC > 3:1, payback < 12 months
- 50+ customers or 50K+ users
- Proven, scalable go-to-market
- Clear path to profitability

**Traction Red Flags:**
- ❌ Vanity metrics without business metrics
- ❌ Revenue heavily concentrated (one customer = 50%+)
- ❌ Slowing or flat growth
- ❌ High churn (>10% monthly)
- ❌ Poor unit economics (LTV:CAC < 1:1)
- ❌ No organic growth or virality
- ❌ Fake or manipulated metrics

### 5. Business Model & Unit Economics

**Business Model Questions:**
- How do you make money?
- What's your pricing model?
- What does the typical customer journey look like?
- What are your unit economics?
- What's your path to profitability?
- How capital efficient is growth?

**Unit Economics Analysis:**

```
Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
= Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) × Gross Margin % ÷ Churn Rate

Example SaaS:
ARPU = $100/month
Gross Margin = 80%
Churn = 2%/month
LTV = $100 × 0.80 ÷ 0.02 = $4,000

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
= Total Sales & Marketing Spend ÷ New Customers Acquired

Example:
Sales & Marketing = $50K/month
New Customers = 50/month
CAC = $50K ÷ 50 = $1,000

LTV:CAC Ratio = $4,000 ÷ $1,000 = 4:1 ✅ (Good!)

Payback Period (months)
= CAC ÷ (ARPU × Gross Margin %)
= $1,000 ÷ ($100 × 0.80) = 12.5 months ✅ (Acceptable)
```

**Target Benchmarks:**
- LTV:CAC ratio: >3:1 (ideally 5:1+)
- Payback period: <12 months (ideally <6 months)
- Gross margin: >70% for SaaS, >50% for marketplaces
- Rule of 40: Growth% + Profit Margin% ≥ 40%
- Burn multiple: Net Burn ÷ Net New ARR < 1.5x

**Business Model Red Flags:**
- ❌ LTV:CAC < 1:1 (losing money on every customer)
- ❌ Payback > 24 months (too long to recover CAC)
- ❌ Gross margin < 50% (not scalable)
- ❌ No clear path to profitability
- ❌ Revenue model unproven
- ❌ Pricing power concerns

## Deal Structuring & Negotiation

### Convertible Note Terms Analysis

**Evaluating Note Terms:**

**Discount Rate (15-25%):**
- **15-20%**: Standard for seed with good traction
- **20-25%**: Pre-seed or higher risk
- **>25%**: Too generous to investors (red flag)
- **<15%**: Too stingy for early-stage risk

**Valuation Cap:**
- **Pre-Seed**: $3M-$6M cap
- **Seed**: $6M-$12M cap
- **Rule**: Cap should be 2-3x implied current valuation
- **Too low**: <2x current (over-dilutive for founders)
- **Too high**: >5x current (no investor protection)

**Interest Rate:**
- **Standard**: 5-8% annually
- **Higher rates**: Don't add much value (small dollars)
- **Accrues**: Compounds into conversion amount

**Maturity:**
- **Standard**: 18-36 months
- **Too short**: <18 months (pressure to raise fast)
- **Too long**: >36 months (misaligned incentives)

**Sample Fair Terms:**

**Pre-Seed ($50K-$250K):**
```
Discount: 20-25%
Cap: $4M-$6M
Interest: 6-8%
Maturity: 24 months
Qualified Financing: $500K minimum
```

**Seed ($250K-$1M):**
```
Discount: 15-20%
Cap: $7M-$10M
Interest: 5-7%
Maturity: 24-36 months
Qualified Financing: $1M minimum
```

**Term Red Flags:**
- ❌ Multiple note rounds with different terms (messy cap table)
- ❌ Participating liquidation preference on conversion
- ❌ Board seats or blocking rights on notes
- ❌ Discount + cap both too aggressive
- ❌ No MFN (Most Favored Nation) protection

### Priced Equity Terms (Series A)

**Standard Series A Terms:**

**Valuation & Economics:**
- Pre-money: Based on traction and comparables
- Investment: $2M-$10M typical for LatAm Series A
- Ownership: 20-30% for lead investor
- Option pool: 15-20% post-money

**Key Terms:**
- **Liquidation Preference**: 1x non-participating (standard)
- **Dividend**: 6-8% cumulative, if/as declared
- **Anti-dilution**: Broad-based weighted average (founder-friendly)
- **Board Seats**: 1-2 seats for lead, 2 founder, 1 independent
- **Protective Provisions**: Standard veto rights
- **Information Rights**: Monthly/quarterly financials
- **Pro Rata Rights**: Maintain ownership in future rounds
- **Drag-Along**: Majority can force sale (60-75% threshold)

**Investor-Friendly vs Founder-Friendly:**

**Investor-Friendly (Aggressive):**
- 1x participating liquidation preference
- Full ratchet anti-dilution
- Cumulative dividends paid in cash
- Redemption rights
- Pay-to-play provisions
- Multiple board seats
- Low drag-along threshold (51%)

**Founder-Friendly (Balanced):**
- 1x non-participating liquidation preference
- Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution
- Dividends if/as declared
- No redemption
- Standard protective provisions
- Balanced board (2-2-1)
- High drag-along threshold (75%+)

**Panama Market Standard:**
Most Series A deals in Panama follow founder-friendly terms with international investors, closer to Silicon Valley standards than aggressive private equity terms.

### Valuation Analysis

**How VCs Think About Valuation:**

**Backwards from Exit:**
```
Desired Return: 10x on investment
Investment: $2M for 20% ownership
Required Exit Value: $2M × 10x ÷ 20% = $100M exit needed

Question: Is $100M exit realistic for this company in 7-10 years?
```

**Comparable Companies Method:**
```
Your Company MRR: $50K ($600K ARR)
Growth Rate: 30% MoM
Comparable SaaS Valuations: 10-15x ARR

Valuation Range: $600K × 10-15x = $6M-$9M post-money
```

**Venture Capital Method:**
```
Exit Value Estimate: $100M in 7 years
Post-Money Valuation: Exit Value ÷ Required Return
= $100M ÷ 10x = $10M today

If raising $2M, investor gets 20% = $10M post-money
Pre-money valuation = $10M - $2M = $8M
```

**Panama/LatAm Discount:**
Many international investors apply 20-30% discount to LatAm companies vs US comparables due to:
- Smaller exit market
- Currency/country risk  
- Less developed venture ecosystem
- Longer timeline to exit

**Valuation Red Flags:**
- ❌ No comparables or benchmarks cited
- ❌ Valuation based on "future potential" without traction
- ❌ Asking for Silicon Valley valuation in LatAm without justification
- ❌ Not willing to justify or defend valuation
- ❌ Valuation much higher than last round without progress

## Portfolio Management Mindset

### Power Law Returns

**Understanding VC Math:**
- 1-2 companies will return the entire fund (10-50x)
- 3-5 companies will return 3-10x
- 5-10 companies will return 1-3x or breakeven
- 10-15 companies will fail or return <1x

**Portfolio Construction:**
- Make 20-30 investments per fund
- Diversify across sectors (but within thesis)
- Diversify across stages (seed, Series A)
- Reserve capital for follow-on rounds (50% of fund)
- Balance risk (moonshots vs safer bets)

**Follow-On Strategy:**
- Double down on winners
- Let losers die (don't throw good money after bad)
- Pro rata rights critical for winners
- Signal to market with participation
- Manage ownership dilution

## Panama & LatAm Context

### Regional Ecosystem Dynamics

**Panama Advantages:**
- USD currency (no FX risk)
- Territorial tax system
- Banking infrastructure
- Geographic position (bridge to LatAm)
- Growing tech community
- Ciudad del Saber hub

**Panama Challenges:**
- Small domestic market (4M people)
- Must expand regionally for scale
- Less developed venture ecosystem
- Fewer experienced tech operators
- Limited follow-on capital
- Exits primarily to internationals

**LatAm Investment Thesis:**
- 650M people, growing middle class
- Digital transformation accelerating
- Underserved markets (fintech, insurtech, B2B SaaS)
- Strong technical talent
- Lower CAC than US
- Regional champions can expand globally

**LatAm-Specific DD Points:**
- Multi-country expansion plan (can't stay local)
- Currency strategy for non-dollar markets
- Regulatory complexity across countries
- Local partnership requirements
- Exit strategy (strategic acquirer or IPO)
- Political/economic stability risks

### Exit Landscape in Panama/LatAm

**Exit Options:**
1. **Strategic Acquisition**: Most common exit
   - US/European company buying LatAm presence
   - Regional consolidation play
   - Acquisition multiples: 3-8x revenue typical

2. **Regional IPO**: Emerging but limited
   - BM&FBOVESPA (Brazil), MILA (Chile, Peru, Colombia)
   - Requires significant scale ($50M+ revenue)
   - Few tech IPOs precedent

3. **Secondary Sale**: To larger VC fund
   - Growth equity or later-stage VC
   - Bridge to eventual exit

4. **Acqui-hire**: Talent acquisition
   - Less preferred but realistic for some

**Realistic Exit Timeline:**
- 7-10 years for successful exit
- Longer than US (less developed M&A market)
- Patience required

**Exit Multiples (LatAm):**
- SaaS: 6-10x ARR (vs 10-15x in US)
- Marketplace: 2-5x GMV (vs 3-7x in US)
- Fintech: 3-7x revenue (depends on model)
- Apply 20-30% discount vs US comparables

## Providing Feedback to Founders

### Constructive Feedback Framework

**When Passing:**
1. **Be Clear and Direct**: Don't ghost, give a definitive no
2. **Be Honest**: Share real reason for pass
3. **Be Helpful**: Suggest what could change your mind
4. **Be Respectful**: They put their life into this
5. **Be Fast**: Don't string them along

**Pass Email Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Company] Investment Discussion

Hi [Founder],

Thank you for sharing [Company] with us. After careful review, 
we've decided to pass on this opportunity at this time.

The primary reason is [honest reason: e.g., "we don't have 
conviction that the market is large enough for VC returns"].

That said, we were impressed by [genuine positive: team, traction, 
product]. If you can demonstrate [specific milestone: e.g., "$50K 
MRR with <5% churn"], we'd love to revisit.

Wishing you success, and please keep us updated on your progress.

Best,
[Investor]
```

**When Interested:**
1. **Show Enthusiasm**: Let them know you're excited
2. **Move Fast**: Schedule next meeting within days
3. **Be Transparent**: Explain your process and timeline
4. **Ask Hard Questions**: Surface issues early
5. **Build Relationship**: This is a long-term partnership

**Red Flags in Your Own Behavior:**
- Ghosting founders (unacceptable)
