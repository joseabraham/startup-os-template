## 📋 Standard Terms Framework

### Core Economic Terms

#### Principal Amount & Minimum Investment
```markdown
DOCUHARMONIZE CONVERTIBLE NOTE STRUCTURE

Principal Amount: $500,000 - $2,000,000 per round
Minimum Investment: $25,000 (accredited investors)
Maximum Investment: No cap (subject to fundraising goal)
Investment Vehicle: Simple promissory note with conversion features
```

#### Interest Rate
**Market Standard**: 6-8% annual simple interest
**DocuHarmonize Rate**: 7% annually
**Rationale**:
- Competitive with market rates for convertible debt
- Higher than risk-free rate but lower than traditional debt
- Reasonable cost of capital for early-stage SaaS company

#### Maturity Date
**Standard Term**: 18-24 months from issuance
**DocuHarmonize Term**: 24 months
**Rationale**:
- Sufficient time to achieve Series A milestones
- Provides flexibility for market timing
- Standard expectation for seed-stage companies

### Conversion Mechanics

#### Automatic Conversion Triggers
1. **Qualified Financing** (Primary Conversion)
   - **Definition**: Series A preferred stock round ≥$3M with majority investor approval
   - **Conversion Price**: Discounted price or valuation cap, whichever is more favorable
   - **Process**: Automatic conversion at Series A closing

2. **Change of Control** (Secondary Conversion)
   - **Definition**: Acquisition, merger, or asset sale >50% of company
   - **Conversion**: Convert to equity immediately prior to transaction
   - **Liquidity**: Participate in transaction proceeds as if equity holder

3. **Maturity Date** (Default Conversion)
   - **Option**: Investor choice to convert at fair market value or demand repayment
   - **Typical Outcome**: Conversion preferred to preserve ongoing relationship

#### Conversion Price Protection

##### Discount Rate
**Standard Range**: 15-25% discount to Series A price
**DocuHarmonize Discount**: 20%
**Calculation**: If Series A price is $1.00/share, convertible holders pay $0.80/share

```markdown
DISCOUNT CALCULATION EXAMPLE

Series A Price: $2.00 per share
Convertible Discount: 20%
Convertible Price: $1.60 per share ($2.00 × 0.80)

$100,000 Note Investment:
- Shares Received: 62,500 shares ($100,000 ÷ $1.60)
- Series A Equivalent: 50,000 shares ($100,000 ÷ $2.00)
- Discount Benefit: 12,500 additional shares (25% more shares)
```

##### Valuation Cap
**Purpose**: Protects investors from excessive dilution if company value increases significantly
**DocuHarmonize Cap**: $15M pre-money valuation
**Market Positioning**: Conservative cap reflecting early-stage risk

```markdown
VALUATION CAP EXAMPLE

Scenario: Series A at $30M pre-money valuation
Series A Price: $3.00 per share
Cap-Based Price: $1.50 per share ($15M cap = 50% discount)
Discount-Based Price: $2.40 per share (20% discount)

Investor Benefits from Cap (more favorable):
$100,000 investment = 66,667 shares at $1.50
vs. 41,667 shares at $2.40 (60% more shares from cap protection)
```

##### Most Favored Nation (MFN) Clause
**Protection**: If subsequent convertible notes have better terms, existing holders automatically receive same benefits
**Standard Practice**: Included in all professional convertible note rounds
**Investor Protection**: Ensures early investors aren't penalized for timing
